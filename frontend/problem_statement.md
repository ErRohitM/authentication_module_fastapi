# Authentication Module Frontend Implementation

## Introduction
This project involves implementing the frontend portion of an authentication system that will interact with an existing FastAPI backend. The frontend will handle user registration, login, profile viewing, and profile editing using ReactJS with TypeScript.

## Problem Statement
Developing a secure, feature-complete authentication module frontend that seamlessly connects to the existing FastAPI backend. The implementation must adhere to specific library requirements and ensure proper authentication flow and route protection.

## Objectives
1. Create a responsive authentication UI using React and TypeScript
2. Implement secure JWT token handling
3. Develop protected routes with proper navigation guards
4. Create user-friendly forms for registration, login, and profile management
5. Ensure a smooth user experience across the authentication flow

## Deliverables
1. Login page with form validation and error handling
2. Registration page with form validation
3. User profile page with display and edit capabilities
4. Protected routes implementation
5. Global authentication state management
6. Responsive UI using Ant Design and Tailwind CSS

## Scope
### In Scope:
- Frontend implementation using React with TypeScript
- Integration with the existing FastAPI backend
- UI components using Ant Design
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Form validation and error handling
- JWT authentication implementation
- Route protection and redirects

### Out of Scope:
- Backend development (already implemented)
- Database management (handled by backend)
- User password recovery functionality
- Advanced user roles and permissions
- Analytics or monitoring features

## Constraints
1. Must use the specified technologies:
   - ReactJS with TypeScript
   - Ant Design (Antd)
   - Tailwind CSS
   - Lodash
2. Must implement the specified authentication flow:
   - Logged-in users should see their profile and be able to edit it
   - Logged-in users should be redirected from login page to user details page
   - Logged-out users should be redirected to login page when attempting to access protected routes
3. Development timeline must align with project schedule

## Assumptions
1. The FastAPI backend is fully functional and accessible
2. API endpoints are properly secured and follow RESTful conventions
3. JWT token authentication is properly implemented on the backend
4. Backend validates form inputs and returns appropriate error messages
5. The API will return user data in a consistent format

## Inputs
1. API endpoints documentation:
   - `/api/auth/register` (POST) - application/json
   - `/api/auth/login` (POST) - x-www-form-urlencoded  
   - `/api/auth/refresh` (POST) - application/json
   - `/api/user/me` (GET) - Requires Bearer token
   - `/api/user/update` (PUT) - application/json
2. Design requirements for UI components
3. Authentication flow requirements
4. Create React App for project initialization
5. Recoil/Context API for state management

## Outputs
1. Functional React TypeScript application
2. Responsive UI with Ant Design components and Tailwind CSS styling
3. Secure authentication flow with JWT token handling
4. Protected routes with appropriate redirects
5. User-friendly forms with validation and error handling
6. User profile display and edit functionality
